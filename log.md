# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working on portfolio page, fixing responsive menu

**Thoughts:** I am struggling to figure out why colors are not applied to my menu and why JS animations do not work. Need to understand more about SCSS and the different versions CSS
